# ekman_bl
Spectral code setup for a stratified Ekman boundary layer. The solver is parallelized in the spanwise direction. The time marching is performed using a third-order RK method. The spatial derivatives are performed using second-order central finite differences in the vertical direction and with a pseudo-spectral method in the horizontal directions.
